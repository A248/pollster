//! A minimal async executor that lets you block on a future
//!
//! Note that `pollster` will not work for *arbitrary* futures because some require a specific runtime or reactor. See
//! [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/08_ecosystem/00_chapter.html#determining-ecosystem-compatibility) for
//! more information about when and where `pollster` may be used. However, if you're already pulling in the required
//! dependencies to create such a future in the first place, it's likely that you already have a version of `block_on`
//! in your dependency tree that's designed to poll your future, so use that instead.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! let my_fut = async {};
//! let result = pollster::block_on(my_fut);
//! ```
